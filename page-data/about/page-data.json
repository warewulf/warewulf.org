Built for performance, maintainability, and automation, Warewulf\nenables system administrators and researchers to deploy clusters rapidly using\nproven, open standards.</p>\n<p>Originally developed to meet the unique needs of the HPC community, Warewulf has\nevolved into a mature, community-driven project trusted in academic, government,\nand commercial environments. With its network-boot model and stateless node\nmanagement, Warewulf delivers efficiency and control to environments where\nperformance, repeatability, and ease of administration are critical.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Warewulf was first released in the early 2000s as a project within the Open\nSource HPC ecosystem. Its creator, Greg Kurtzer, developed Warewulf as a\nlightweight alternative to traditional cluster management systems, focusing on\nthe specific provisioning needs of HPC environments. It gained early adoption at\nnational laboratories and universities for its simplicity, scalability, and\nintegration with existing Linux tools.</p>\n<p>As the complexity of cluster deployments grew, so did Warewulf. Over the years,\nit has evolved to support container-based provisioning, secure boot methods, and\nintegration with modern infrastructure components. Warewulf 4, the most recent\nmajor version, represents a significant architectural leap forward â€” rebuilt\nfrom the ground up with Go, YAML-based configurations, and a simplified, modular\ndesign.</p>\n<h2>Project Vision and Goals</h2>\n<p>At its core, Warewulf exists to make HPC provisioning easier, faster, and more\nmaintainable without sacrificing flexibility or control. Our vision is to\nempower organizations of all sizes â€” from research labs and universities to\nenterprises and hyperscalers â€” with the tools to manage their clusters reliably\nand repeatably.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stateless Simplicity:</strong> Remove unnecessary complexity by managing node\nimages and configurations centrally, enabling true stateless booting and\nprovisioning.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance at Scale:</strong> Ensure that cluster deployment and management is\nfast, lightweight, and scalable across thousands of nodes.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Collaboration:</strong> Grow a vibrant open source community where\ncontributions are welcomed, use cases are shared, and innovation thrives.</li>\n<li><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> Evolve Warewulf to support hardened operating\nsystem images, secure boot environments, and modern compliance needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Integration and Extensibility:</strong> Play well with other tools and ecosystems\nâ€” including Ansible, container runtimes, Slurm, and beyond.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Growth and Adoption</h2>\n<p>Warewulf continues to see adoption across a wide range of sectors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Academic Research:</strong> Supporting data-intensive research through efficient\ncluster management.</li>\n<li><strong>Government and National Labs:</strong> Providing scalable, secure provisioning in\nmission-critical environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Commercial HPC:</strong> Delivering reproducible cluster deployments in biotech,\nfinance, manufacturing, and AI/ML workloads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Commercial support for Warewulf is available through <a href=\"https://ciq.com\">CIQ</a> and\n<a href=\"https://suse.com\">SUSE</a>, ensuring organizations can rely on trusted partners for\nenterprise-grade assistance, consulting, and lifecycle support.</p>\n<p>The project is actively maintained by a growing group of contributors and\ncollaborators. Community feedback, feature requests, and bug reports directly\nshape Warewulfâ€™s development. Whether youâ€™re deploying your first cluster or\nmanaging thousands of compute nodes, Warewulf is here to simplify your journey.</p>\n<h2>Governance</h2>\n<p>Warewulf is an open-source, community-driven project committed to transparent\nand collaborative development. Oversight of the projectâ€™s technical direction is\nprovided by our <strong>Technical Steering Committee (TSC)</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Technical Steering Committee (TSC)</h3>\n<p>The TSC meets regularly to discuss project roadmap updates, major feature\nplanning, community feedback, and community contributions. These meetings are\nopen to the public, and everyone is welcome to attend, observe, or participate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Guide the technical vision and ensure the long-term\nsustainability of Warewulf.</li>\n<li><strong>Participation:</strong> Community members are encouraged to join meetings, suggest\nagenda items, and contribute to discussions.</li>\n<li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Meetings are held on the <strong>1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month\nat 12:30 PM Pacific Time</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Access:</strong> Meeting details are shared inside the Warewulf community Slack\nChannel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Meeting Recordings</h3>\n<p>All TSC meetings are recorded and published to our YouTube channel to promote\nopenness and accessibility.</p>\n<p>ðŸ‘‰ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@warewulfhpc\">Watch TSC Meetings on YouTube</a></p>\n<h2>Get Involved</h2>\n<p>Warewulf thrives because of its community.
