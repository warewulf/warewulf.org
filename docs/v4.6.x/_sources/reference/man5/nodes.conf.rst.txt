NAME
====

nodes.conf - Warewulf node configuration database

DESCRIPTION
===========

**nodes.conf** is the primary database file for all compute nodes (and
node profiles). It is a flat text YAML configuration file that is
managed by **wwctl(1)**.

While manual editing of the **nodes.conf** file is possible and can be
useful, the internal structure of the file is subject to change without
notice between Warewulf versions. The recommended and only supported
mechanism for updating **nodes.conf** is via **wwctl(1)**.
