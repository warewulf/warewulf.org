NAME
====

warewulf.conf - Warewulf server configuration file

DESCRIPTION
===========

**warewulf.conf** is the main configuration file for the Warewulf server
daemon and defines the configuration for its service dependencies,
including dhcp, tftp, and nfs.

warewulf.conf is defined using YAML document markup syntax.

PARAMETERS
==========

The configuration parameters available include:

**ipaddr**
   This is the control node's networking interface connecting to the
   cluster's private network. This configuration must match the host's
   network IP address for the cluster's private interface.

**ipaddr6**
   This is the control node's networking interface connecting to the
   cluster's IPv6 private network. This configuration must match the
   host's network IP address for the cluster's private interface.

**network**
   The subnet address for the cluster's private network, used in
   conjunction with the netmask parameter.

**netmask**
   Similar to the ipaddr, this is the subnet mask for the cluster's
   private network and it must also match the host's subnet mask for the
   cluster's private interface.

WAREWULF
--------

The **warewulf** parameter is a map of individual sub-parameters which
configure Warewulf specifically. (See the **EXAMPLE** section for
overall structure.)

**port**
   This is the port that the Warewulf web server will be listening on.
   It is recommended not to change this so there is no misalignment with
   node's expectations of how to contact the Warewulf service.

Default: 9873

**secure**
   When true, this limits the Warewulf server to only respond to runtime
   overlay requests originating from a privileged port. This prevents
   non-root users from requesting the runtime overlay, which may contain
   sensitive information.

When true, wwclient uses TCP port 987.

Changing this option requires rebuilding node overlays and rebooting
compute nodes, to configure them to use a privileged port.

Default: true

**update interval**
   The frequency (in seconds) with which wwclient will fetch its
   configuration (e.g., its overlays) from the Warewulf server.

Default: 60

**autobuild overlays**
   When true, overlays will be automatically rebuilt when indicated by
   changes to nodes, profiles, and overlays.

Default: true

**host overlay**
   Host overlays are used to configure dependent services on the
   Warewulf server. When disabled, these services' configuration files
   will not be updated by **wwctl-configure(1)**.

Default: true

**syslog**
   When true, Warewulf server logs are written to syslog.

Default: false

**datastore**
   The location where Warewulf caches and stores OCI data.

Default: /var/lib/warewulf

DHCP
----

The **dhcp** parameter is a map of individual sub-parameters which
inform how **wwctl-configure(1)** should configure the DHCP service.
(See the **EXAMPLE** section for overall structure.)

**enabled**
   When false, the DHCP service will not be configured by
   **wwctl-configure(1)**.

Default: true

**range start**
   An IP address which defines the start of a dynamic address range
   which can be used when configuring the DHCP service. Provided to the
   host overlay as the variable **$.Dhcp.RangeStart**, typically for use
   in generating dhcpd.conf or similar.

Templates typically expect this range to be within the **network**
defined above.

**range end**
   An IP address which defines the end of a dynamic address range which
   can be used when configuring the DHCP service. Provided to the host
   overlay as the variable **$.Dhcp.RangeEnd**, typically for use in
   generating dhcpd.conf or similar.

Templates typically expect this range to be within the **network**
defined above.

**systemd name**
   The systemd unit name which will be used to (re)start the DHCP
   service during **wwctl-configure(1)**, if necessary.

Default: dhcpd

TFTP
----

The **tftp** parameter is a map of individual sub-parameters which
inform how **wwctl-configure(1)** should configure the TFTP service.
(See the **EXAMPLE** section for overall structure.)

**enabled**
   When false, the TFTP service will not be configured by
   **wwctl-configure(1)**.

Default: true

**systemd name**
   The systemd unit name which will be used to (re)start the TFTP
   service during **wwctl-configure(1)**, if necessary.

Default: tftp

NFS
---

The nfs parameter is a map of individual sub-parameters which inform how
**wwctl-configure(1)** should configure the NFS service. (See the
**EXAMPLE** section for overall structure.)

**enabled**
   When false, the NFS service will not be configured by
   **wwctl-configure(1)**.

Default: true

**export paths**
   A list of paths to be exported by the NFS service. Each item in the
   list is, itself, a map of parameters for the export. (See the
   **EXAMPLE** section for overall structure.)

   **path**
      The path on the server to be exported via the NFS service.
      Provided to the host overlay as the variable
      **.Nfs.ExportsExtended[].Path**, typically for use in generating
      /etc/exports or similar.

   **export options**
      The NFS export options to use when exporting the given **path**
      via the NFS service. Provided to the host overlay as the variable
      **.Nfs.ExportsExtended[].ExportOptions**, typically for use in
      generating /etc/exports or similar.

   Default: rw,sync,no_subtree_check

**systemd name**
   The systemd unit name which will be used to (re)start the NFS service
   during **wwctl-configure(1)**, if necessary.

Default: nfsd
