wwctl completion zsh
--------------------

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~


Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(wwctl completion zsh)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	wwctl completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_wwctl"

#### macOS:

	wwctl completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_wwctl

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
