=============

You can contribute to the documentation by `raising an issue to suggest an
improvement <https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/issues/new>`_ or by sending a
`pull request <https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/compare>`_ on `our GitHub
repository <https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf>`_.

The current documentation is generated with `Sphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

For more information on using Git and GitHub to create a pull request
suggesting additions and edits to the docs, see the `section on
contributing to the code <contributing>`_. The procedure is identical
for contributions to documentation and code.
