Image Management
================

Since the inception of Warewulf over 20 years ago, Warewulf has used
the model of the "Virtual Node File System" (VNFS) as a template image
for the compute nodes. This is similar to a golden master image,
except that the node file system exists within a directory on the
Warewulf control node (e.g. a ``chroot()``).

Meanwhile, the enterprise has created
a lot of tooling and standards around defining, building,
distributing, securing, and managing containers, so Warewulf v4 now
integrates directly within the container ecosystem to facilitate the
process of image management.

If you are not currently leveraging the container ecosystem in any
other way, you can still build your own chroot directories and use
Warewulf as before.

It is important to understand that Warewulf is not running a container
runtime on cluster nodes. While it is absolutely possible to run
containers on cluster nodes, Warewulf is provisioning the
image to the bare metal and booting it. This image will be used as
the base operating system and, by default, it will run entirely in
memory. This means that when you reboot the node, the node retains no
information about Warewulf or how it booted.

Tools
=====

There are different container managment tools available. Docker is
probably the most recognizable one in the enterprise. Podman is
another one that is gaining traction on the RHEL platforms. In HPC,
Apptainer is the most utilized image management tool. You can use
any of these to create and manage the containers to be later imported
into Warewulf.

Importing Images
================

Warewulf supports importing an image from any OCI compliant
registry. This means you can import from a public registry or from a
private registry.

Here is an example of importing from Docker Hub.

.. code-block:: console

   # wwctl image import docker://ghcr.io/warewulf/warewulf-rockylinux:8 rocky-8
   Getting image source signatures
   Copying blob d7f16ed6f451 done
   Copying config da2ca70704 done
   Writing manifest to image destination
   Storing signatures
   [LOG]       info unpack layer: sha256:d7f16ed6f45129c7f4adb3773412def4ba2bf9902de42e86e77379a65d90a984
   Updating the image's /etc/resolv.conf
   Building image: rocky-8

.. note::

    Most images in Docker Hub are not "bootable", in that, they
    have a limited version of Systemd to make them lighter weight for
    image purposes. For this reason, don't expect any base Docker
    image (e.g. ``docker://rockylinux`` or ``docker://debian``) to
    boot properly. They will not, as they will get stuck into a single
    user mode. The images in `https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf-node-images
    <https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf-node-images>`_ are not limited and thus
    they boot as you would expect.

Platform
--------

By default,
Warewulf will try to import an image of the same platform
(e.g., amd64, arm64)
as the local system.
To specify the platform to import,
either specify `WAREWULF_OCI_PLATFORM`
or use the argument `--platform` during import.

Private Registry
----------------

It is possible to use a private registry that is password protected or
does not have the requirement for TLS. In order to do so, you have two
choices for handling the credentials.

* Set environmental variables
* Use ``docker login`` or ``podman login`` which will store the
  credentials locally

Please note, there is no requirement to install and use docker or
podman on your control node just for importing images into Warewulf.

Here are the environmental variables that can be used.

.. code-block:: console

   WAREWULF_OCI_USERNAME
   WAREWULF_OCI_PASSWORD
   WAREWULF_OCI_NOHTTPS

They can be overwritten with ``--nohttps``, ``--username`` and ``--password``.
.. code-block:: console

   # wwctl import --username tux --password supersecret docker://ghcr.io/privatereg/rocky:8

The above is just an example. Consideration should be done before
doing it this way if you are in a security sensitive environment or
shared environments as this command line wil show up in the process 
table.

Local Files
-----------

It is also possible to import an image from a local file or
directory. For example, Podman can save a `.tar` archive of an OCI
image. This archive can be directly imported into Warewulf, no
registry required.

.. code-block:: console

   # podman save alpine:latest >alpine.tar
   # wwctl image import alpine.tar alpine

Chroot directories and Apptainer sandbox images can also be imported
directly.

.. code-block:: console

   $ apptainer build --sandbox ./rockylinux-8/ docker://ghcr.io/warewulf/warewulf-rockylinux:8
   $ sudo wwctl image import ./rockylinux-8/ rockylinux-8

.. note::

   If a source directory includes persistent sockets, these sockets may cause the import operation to fail.

   .. code-block:: console

      Copying sources...
      ERROR  : could not import image: lchown ./rockylinux-8/run/user/0/gnupg/d.kg8ijih5tq41ixoeag4p1qup/S.gpg-agent: no such file or directory

   To resolve this, remove the sockets from the source directory.

   .. code-block:: bash

      find ./rockylinux-8/ -type s -delete

HTTP proxies
------------

You can set ``HTTP_PROXY``, ``HTTPS_PROXY``, and ``NO_PROXY`` (or their
lower-case versions) to use a proxy during ``wwctl image import``.

.. code-block:: shell

   export HTTPS_PROXY=squid.localdomain
   wwctl image import docker://ghcr.io/warewulf/warewulf-rockylinux:8

See ProxyFromEnvironment_ For more information.

.. _ProxyFromEnvironment: https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ProxyFromEnvironment

.. note::

   OCI and ORAS registries typically use HTTPS, so you probably need to set
   ``HTTPS_PROXY`` or ``https_proxy`` rather than the ``HTTP`` variants.

Syncuser
========

At import time Warewulf checks if the names of the users on the host
match the users and UIDs/GIDs in the imported image. If there is
mismatch, the import command will print out a warning.  By setting the
``--syncuser`` flag you advise Warewulf to try to syncronize the users
from the host to the image, which means that ``/etc/passwd`` and
``/etc/group`` of the imported image are updated and all the files
belonging to these UIDs and GIDs will also be updated.

A check if the users of the host and image matches can be
triggered with the ``syncuser`` command.

.. code-block:: console

   # wwctl image syncuser image-name

With the ``--write`` flag it will update the image to match the
user database of the host as described above.

.. code-block:: console

   wwctl image syncuser --write image-name

Listing All Imported Images
===========================

Once the image has been imported, you can list them all with the
following command:

.. code-block:: console

   # wwctl image list
   IMAGE NAME
   ----------
   rocky-8

Once an image has been imported and showing up in this list you can
configure it to boot compute nodes.

Making Changes To Images
========================

You can run commands inside of any of the images and make changes to
them as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   # wwctl image exec rocky-8 /bin/sh
   [rocky-8] Warewulf> cat /etc/rocky-release
   Rocky Linux release 8.4 (Green Obsidian)
   [rocky-8] Warewulf> exit
   Rebuilding image...
   [INFO]     Skipping (image is current)

You can also ``--bind`` directories from your host into the image
when using the exec command. This works as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   # wwctl image shell --bind /tmp:/mnt rocky-8
   [rocky-8] Warewulf>

.. note::

   As with any mount command, both the source and the target must
   exist. This is why the example uses the ``/mnt/`` directory
   location, as it is almost always present and empty in every Linux
   distribution (as prescribed by the LSB file hierarchy standard).

Files which should always be present in an image like ``resolv.conf``
can be specified in ``warewulf.conf``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   image mounts:
   - source: /etc/resolv.conf
     dest: /etc/resolv.conf
     readonly: true

.. note::

   Instead of ``readonly: true`` you can set ``copy: true``. This causes the
   source file to be copied to the image and removed if it was not
   modified. This can be useful for files used for registrations.

When the command completes, if anything within the image changed,
the image will be rebuilt into a bootable static object
automatically. (To skip the automatic image rebuild, specify ``--build=false``.)

If the files ``/etc/passwd`` or ``/etc/group`` were updated, there
will be an additional check to confirm if the users are in sync as
described in `Syncuser`_ section.

Excluding Files from an Image
-----------------------------

Warewulf can exclude files from an image source to prevent them
from being delivered to the compute node. This is typically used to
reduce the size of the image when some files are unnecessary.

Patterns for excluded files are read from the file
``/etc/warewulf/excludes`` in the image itself. For example,
the default Rocky Linux images exclude these paths:

.. code-block::

   /boot/
   /usr/share/GeoIP

``/etc/warewulf/excludes`` supports the patterns implemented by
`filepath.Match <https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match>`_.

Preparing an image for build
----------------------------

Warewulf executes the script ``/etc/warewulf/image_exit.sh`` after
a ``wwctl image shell`` or ``wwctl image exec`` and prior to
(re)building the final node image for delivery. This is typically used
to remove cache or log files that may have been generated by the
executed command or interactive session.

For example, the default Rocky Linux images runs ``dnf clean all`` to
remove any package repository caches that may have been generated.

Creating Images From Scratch
============================

You can also create images from scratch and import those
images into Warewulf as previous versions of Warewulf did.

Building An Image From Your Host
--------------------------------

RPM based distributions, as well as Debian variants can all bootstrap
mini ``chroot()`` directories which can then be used to bootstrap your
node's image.

For example, on an RPM based Linux distribution with YUM or DNF, you
can do something like the following:

.. code-block:: console

   # yum install --installroot /tmp/newroot basesystem bash \
       chkconfig coreutils e2fsprogs ethtool filesystem findutils \
       gawk grep initscripts iproute iputils net-tools nfs-utils pam \
       psmisc rsync sed setup shadow-utils rsyslog tzdata util-linux \
       words zlib tar less gzip which util-linux openssh-clients \
       openssh-server dhclient pciutils vim-minimal shadow-utils \
       strace cronie crontabs cpio wget rocky-release ipmitool yum \
       NetworkManager

You can do something similar with Debian-based distributions:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install debootstrap
   # debootstrap stable /tmp/newroot http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian

Once you have created and modified your new ``chroot()``, you can
import it into Warewulf with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   # wwctl image import /tmp/newroot imagename

Building An Image Using Apptainer
---------------------------------

Apptainer, an image platform for HPC and performance intensive
applications, can also be used to create node images for
Warewulf. There are several Apptainer image recipes in the
``images/Apptainer/`` directory and can be found on GitHub at
`https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/tree/main/images/Apptainer
<https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/tree/main/images/Apptainer>`_.

You can use these as starting points and adding any additional steps
you want in the ``%post`` section of the recipe file. Once you've done
that, installing Apptainer, building an image sandbox and importing
into Warewulf can be done with the following steps:

.. code-block:: console

   # yum install epel-release
   # yum install Apptainer
   # Apptainer build --sandbox /tmp/newroot /path/to/Apptainer/recipe.def
   # wwctl image import /tmp/newroot imagename

Building An Image Using Podman
------------------------------

You can also build an image using podman via a ``Dockerfile``. For
this step the image must be exported to a tar archive, which then
can be imported to Warewulf. The following steps will create an
openSUSE Leap image and import it to Warewulf:

.. code-block:: console

  # podman build -f images/Docker/openSUSE/Imagefile --tag leap-ww
  # podman save localhost/leap-ww:latest  -o ~/leap-ww.tar
  # wwctl image import file://root/leap-ww.tar leap-ww

Image Size Considerations
=========================

Base compute node images start quite small (a few hundred
megabytes), but can grow quickly as packages and other files are added
to them. Even these larger images are typically not an issue in modern
environments; but some architectural limits exist that can impede the
use of images larger than a few gigabytes. Workarounds exist for these
issues in most circumstances:

* Systems booting in legacy / BIOS mode, being a 32-bit environment,
  cannot boot an image that requires more than 4GB to decompress. This
  means that the compressed image and the decompressed image together
  must be < 4GB. This is typically reported by the system as "No space
  left on device (https://ipxe.org/34182006)."

  The best work-around for this limitation is to switch to UEFI. UEFI
  is 64-bit and should support booting significantly larger images,
  though sometimes system-specific implementation details have led to
  artificial limitations on image size.

* The Linux kernel itself can only decompress an image up to 4GB due
  to the use of 32-bit integers in critical sections of the kernel
  initrd decompression code.

  The best work-around for this limitation is to use an iPXE with
  support for `imgextract <https://ipxe.org/cmd/imgextract>`_. This
  allows iPXE to decompress the image rather than the kernel.

* Some BIOS / firmware retain a "memory hole" feature for legacy
  devices, e.g., reserving a 1MB block of memory at the 15MB-16MB
  address range. this feature can interfere with booting stateless
  node images.

  If you are still getting "Not enough memory" or "No space left on
  device" errors, try disabling any "memory hole" features or updating
  your system BIOS or firmware.

Duplicating an image
====================

It is possible to duplicate an installed image by using:

.. code-block:: console

  # wwctl image copy IMAGE_NAME DUPLICATED_IMAGE_NAME

This kind of duplication can be useful if you are looking for canary tests.

.. note::

   If an image source includes persistent sockets, these sockets may cause the copy operation to fail.

   .. code-block:: console

      Copying sources...
      ERROR  : could not duplicate image: lchown /var/lib/warewulf/chroots/rocky-8/rootfs/run/user/0/gnupg/d.kg8ijih5tq41ixoeag4p1qup/S.gpg-agent: no such file or directory

   To resolve this, remove the sockets from the image source.

   .. code-block:: bash

      find $(wwctl image show rocky-8) -type s -delete

Multi-arch image management
===========================

It is possible to build, edit, and provision images of different
architectures (i.e. aarch64) from an x86_64 host by using QEMU. Simply 
run the appropriate command below based on your image management tools.

.. code-block:: console

   # sudo docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
   # sudo podman run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
   # sudo singularity run docker://multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes

Then, ``wwctl image exec`` will work regardless of the architecture of the image.
For more information about QEMU, see their `GitHub <https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static>`_

To use wwclient on a booted image using a different architecture,
wwclient must be compiled for the specific architecture. This requires GOLang build
tools 1.21 or newer. Below is an example for building wwclient for arm64:

.. code-block:: console

   # git clone https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf
   # cd warewulf
   # GOARCH=arm64 PREFIX=/ make wwclient
   # mkdir -p /var/lib/warewulf/overlays/wwclient_arm64/rootfs/warewulf
   # cp wwclient /var/lib/warewulf/overlays/wwclient_arm64/rootfs/warewulf

Then, apply the new "wwclient_arm64" system overlay to your arm64 node/profile

Read-only images
================

An image may be marked "read-only" by creating a ``readonly`` file in its
source directory, typically next to ``rootfs``.

.. note::

   Read-only images are a preview feature primarily meant to enable future
   support for image subscriptions and updates.
