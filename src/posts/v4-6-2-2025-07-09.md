The Warewulf project is pleased to announce the release of Warewulf v4.6.2,
[now available on GitHub][1].

[1]: https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/releases/tag/v4.6.2

Warewulf v4.6.2 was intended to be a regularly-scheduled minor release in the
v4.6.x series, but its release was delayed to include a preview of the ability
to provision node images to local disk, an alternative to provisioning to
volatile memory.

- (preview) support for provisioning to local disk
- improvements to the REST API
- removal of gRPC API infrastructure
- other misc. documentation and bug fixes

Significant changes are detailed in the [release
notes](https://warewulf.org/docs/v4.6.x/release/v4.6.2.html). Additional
changes may be listed in the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

To our contributors, and everyone who uses Warewulf: thank you, as always, for
being a part of the Warewulf community!
