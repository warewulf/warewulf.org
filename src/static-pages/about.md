title: About Warewulf
---

Warewulf is a powerful, scalable, and flexible stateless provisioning system
designed to simplify the deployment and management of High Performance Computing
(HPC) clusters. Built for performance, maintainability, and automation, Warewulf
enables system administrators and researchers to deploy clusters rapidly using
proven, open standards.

Originally developed to meet the unique needs of the HPC community, Warewulf has
evolved into a mature, community-driven project trusted in academic, government,
and commercial environments. With its network-boot model and stateless node
management, Warewulf delivers efficiency and control to environments where
performance, repeatability, and ease of administration are critical.

## History

Warewulf was first released in the early 2000s as a project within the Open
Source HPC ecosystem. Its creator, Greg Kurtzer, developed Warewulf as a
lightweight alternative to traditional cluster management systems, focusing on
the specific provisioning needs of HPC environments. It gained early adoption at
national laboratories and universities for its simplicity, scalability, and
integration with existing Linux tools.

As the complexity of cluster deployments grew, so did Warewulf. Over the years,
it has evolved to support container-based provisioning, secure boot methods, and
integration with modern infrastructure components. Warewulf 4, the most recent
major version, represents a significant architectural leap forward â€” rebuilt
from the ground up with Go, YAML-based configurations, and a simplified, modular
design.

## Project Vision and Goals

At its core, Warewulf exists to make HPC provisioning easier, faster, and more
maintainable without sacrificing flexibility or control. Our vision is to
empower organizations of all sizes â€” from research labs and universities to
enterprises and hyperscalers â€” with the tools to manage their clusters reliably
and repeatably.

- **Stateless Simplicity:** Remove unnecessary complexity by managing node
  images and configurations centrally, enabling true stateless booting and
  provisioning.
- **Performance at Scale:** Ensure that cluster deployment and management is
  fast, lightweight, and scalable across thousands of nodes.
- **Community Collaboration:** Grow a vibrant open source community where
  contributions are welcomed, use cases are shared, and innovation thrives.
- **Security and Compliance:** Evolve Warewulf to support hardened operating
  system images, secure boot environments, and modern compliance needs.
- **Integration and Extensibility:** Play well with other tools and ecosystems
  â€” including Ansible, container runtimes, Slurm, and beyond.

## Growth and Adoption

Warewulf continues to see adoption across a wide range of sectors, including:

- **Academic Research:** Supporting data-intensive research through efficient
  cluster management.
- **Government and National Labs:** Providing scalable, secure provisioning in
  mission-critical environments.
- **Commercial HPC:** Delivering reproducible cluster deployments in biotech,
  finance, manufacturing, and AI/ML workloads.

The project is actively maintained by a growing group of contributors and
collaborators. Community feedback, feature requests, and bug reports directly
shape Warewulfâ€™s development. Whether youâ€™re deploying your first cluster or
managing thousands of compute nodes, Warewulf is here to simplify your journey.

## Governance

Warewulf is an open-source, community-driven project committed to transparent
and collaborative development. Oversight of the projectâ€™s technical direction is
provided by our **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**.

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
The TSC meets regularly to discuss project roadmap updates, major feature
planning, community feedback, and community contributions. These meetings are
open to the public, and everyone is welcome to attend, observe, or participate.

- **Purpose:** Guide the technical vision and ensure the long-term
  sustainability of Warewulf.
- **Participation:** Community members are encouraged to join meetings, suggest
  agenda items, and contribute to discussions.
- **Schedule:** Meetings are held on the **1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month
  at 12:30 PM Pacific Time**.
- **Access:** Meeting details are shared inside the Warewulf community Slack
  Channel.

### Meeting Recordings

All TSC meetings are recorded and published to our YouTube channel to promote
openness and accessibility.
